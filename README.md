# TrainScheduler

## Overview

This project is a Train Schedule Advanced application that works with firebase.  Open the [project start page](https://cnikolai.github.io/TrainSchedulerAdvanced2/). Click on Train Scheduler.  Enter the information in the input fields.  Be sure to note the format of the inputs.  Edit puts the train information in the section below.  Edit this information.  Then click on submit and it will change your train information.  

### Problem 
This system is a platform where users can add trains to the train scheduler and then they can immediately see when the next train is coming.   

### How I solved it
This game uses frontend and backend technology.  

### Technical Approach
I solved this problem by using a combination of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Javascript. I used HTML to create the structure of the page.  I used CSS to style the page.  I use JQuery to edit and append the elements of the DOM.  I used firebase to create a backend database in the cloud.  I used the momment.js library to format the train times into an appropriate time format.
